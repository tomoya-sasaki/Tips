## Markdown

Markdown is an easy to read and write text format:

- It's _plain text_ so works well with version control
- It can be **rendered** into HTML, PDF, and more with `Command+Shift+k`
- Learn more at: <https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/>

## Code Cell

Here is a Python code cell:

```{python}
#| label: test
#| fig-cap: "test"
import os
os.cpu_count()
```

## Equation

Use LaTeX to write equations:

$$
chi' = \sum_{i=1}^n k_i s_i^2 + 3
$$
